Sync Hover Function Guide for interactive Maps / Story-Telling mode with Scollama example 

This is a basic guide on how I learned to make a synced up mouse hover function in javascript. The first one shows the steps to make sure that the mouse area is synced up and the second file shows how to make the storytelling mode alonside Scrollama better. Although the code is a bit unclean it got the job done. I hope this will be useful for anyone who just started learning to code like I did a couple months ago. 

The example provided in the html is from this map: https://rl05262n.github.io/Mapboxnew/syncmap2hover.html
